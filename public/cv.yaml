          as docker build slaves, docker image builds, and deploying stacks to
          docker swarm for each tester.
      - title: SVN to Git Migration
        description: >-
          Helped with moving sources from SVN to Git.  Implemented a branching
          strategy which allowed the team to work on features independently, and
          integrated code reviews via pull request workflow.
      - title: Ant to Gradle Migration
        description: >-
          Switched the Ant with shell scripts build solution to Gradle which
          drastically shortened build time, reduced source repository size, and
          improved maintainability. This also lessen the effort for new
          developers to start working on ADO.
      - title: Perimeter Security
        description: >-
          Implemented a pre-authentication server which authenticates users and
          issues temporary access tokens (JWT) that allows authenticated users
          to gain a secure session with the ADO web application.  Secure
          sessions were also implemented using JWT.
